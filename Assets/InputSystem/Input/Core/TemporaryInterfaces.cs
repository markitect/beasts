////TODO: Right now, we don't have the ability to isolate C# code that references concrete implementations
////  directly. The custom NSubstitute fork that's being worked on will solve that. When that is ready,
////  these interface should be killed and the tests should do Substitute.For<> directly on the concrete
////  implementations.
